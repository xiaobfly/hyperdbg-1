**Note**
We're fortunate to have a community of highly skilled system engineers and reverse engineers contributing to HyperDbg. However, as an open-source, community-driven debugger, our resources and developer time are limited.

Since most HyperDbg users are professional programmers, we encourage you to contribute by submitting pull requests (PRs) whenever possible. While we will address requests for new features created by users, we greatly appreciate your efforts to add them independently and submit PRs. If you're unable to create a PR, please feel free to create your request, and we'll do our best to address it. You can also create issues or discussions to discuss the possible features that you want to add to HyperDbg.

Thank you for requesting new features and for your contributions! ❤️
